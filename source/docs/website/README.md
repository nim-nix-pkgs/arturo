Here you can find all of the files needed for the official website.

**A brief overview:**

- `/pages` - all of the website's "pages" 
    - `/documentation` - the "documentation" section (you may touch anything but the `/library` subfolder)
- `/theme` - files (HTML, CSS, JS) and templates used to generate the main website
