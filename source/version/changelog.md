v0.9.81
========

### Documentation

- Added numerous new Rosetta Code examples
- Minor fixes in existing examples and/or function signatures

### Language

- Added new `:rational` type (along with all relevant operations)
- Added new `:quantity` type (measurements + unit support, along with all relevant operations)

### Library

**New**
- Arithmetic: added new `divmod` method

- Collections\sort: added `.ascii` option & fixed to also work with empty blocks
- Collections\take: fixed to also work with empty blocks
- Converters\to: added support for `:complex` to `:block` conversion
- Core\case: made function work with null sets (Ã¸)
- Iterators: all iterator methods re-implemented and now work with a `.with` option and also with a `null` param block
- Iterators\filter: added `.first` and `.last` options
- Iterators\select: added `.first` and `.last` options
- Numbers: made all trigonometric function work with `:quantity` values
- Numbers\product: added `.cartesian` option
- Numbers\range: make function work even with .step =< 0
- Reflection\info: show origin module for built-in functions/constants

### Misc

- Fixed multi-line string handling in REPL
- Fixed thick-arrow-right (`=>`) syntac sugar handling in label + function assignments
- Fixed handling of arithmetic operations between `:floating` values and *big* `:integer` values
- Fixed handling of Unicode, locale-dependent sorting (including non-ASCII languages & sorting using digraphs/trigraphs, e.g. Hungarian)
- Functions in dictionaries are now directly callable (e.g. `dict\f 10`)

v0.9.7.2
========

- Vast improvement of error reporting, avoiding crashes and with much more helpful error messages
- Greatly enhanced REPL - with saveable/restorable history, tab-completions and as-you-type hints
- Updated workflows: added support for Windows & FreeBSD pre-built binaries in Releases & Nightly builds (mini versions)
- Fixed packager script
- Codebase cleanup
- Numerous minor fixes & additions
